## About The Project

Utilizing the GitHub API, this application lets you search for a name or username of any GitHub user and then presents you with a streamlined user bio page along with their most recent five repositories. This application was initially written using class components with App level state management. I then refactored the app to functional components utilizing React Hooks and managing state using Context.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Use this app to search for users based on matches to usernames from GitHub. The results will then give you a streamlined interface to see recent work and some highlighted information including recent repos, if they are looking for work, etc. If more information is needed, a link to their full user profile is available.
